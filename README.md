# NS2Win
 Rainmeter skin to display your Nightscout glucose on your Windows device using Rainmeter.
 
The main branch will be a working copy of the .ini file you need to put in your Rainmeter directory. The dev branch is going to be for furture developements and additions before I merge to main.

Version 1.0.0 I've added the .rmskin file so you can simply download and double click to install it if your running Rainmeter. You'll need to edit the .ini file inside the skin and look variables section and update them with your information.
